== Overview ==

sfIconPlugin is a Symfony plugin. It gives a set of icons (thanks to dryicons.com, see http://dryicons.com/free-icons/preview/aesthetica ) and a set of helper used to display the icon on the templates. 

== Requirements ==

This plugin has no dependencies on other sfPlugins

== Installation ==

You can install sfIconPlugin via PEAR (recommended) package manager or manually.
=== PEAR installation ===

 1. The easiest way to install sfIconPlugin is to use PEAR package manager.

 {{{
 $ symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfIconPlugin
 }}}

 Alternatively, if you don't have PEAR installed, you can download the latest package attached to this plugin's wiki page and extract it under your project's `plugins/` directory. You will also have to copy the contents of the `myproject/plugins/sfIconPlugin/web/` directory into a `myproject/web/sfIconPlugin/` directory.

 2. Now clear the cache with symfony clear-cache command to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:

 {{{
 $ symfony cc
 }}}

== Configuration ==

No configuration is needed

== Usage ==

Before using sfIcon helpers you need to load them with `use_helper` statement.

{{{
    <?php use_helper('sfIcon'); ?>
}}}

Than you can use the simplest icon image tag
{{{
    <?php echo icon_add_tag(); ?>
}}}

This produce the tag image for small icons (16x16) add.png. 
You you need bigger icons than use the following:
24x24:
{{{
    <?php echo icon_add_tag('normal'); ?>
}}}
32x32:
{{{
    <?php echo icon_add_tag('large'); ?>
}}}
48x48:
{{{
    <?php echo icon_add_tag('huge'); ?>
}}}

For a generic image use
{{{
    <?php echo icon_tag($image_name,$size); ?>
}}}
Where size is a string with the usual values: small (default value), normal, large, huge.

If you want to see the complete list of icons browse the directory plugins/sfIconPlugin/web/images/icons/16x16.

A path equivalent heleper is present:
{{{
    <?php echo icon_path($image_name,$size); ?>
}}}
